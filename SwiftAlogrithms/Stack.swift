	/// Because stacks increase their allocated capacity using an exponential
	/// strategy, pushing a single element to a stack is an O(1) operation
	/// when averaged over many calls to the `push(_:)` method. When an stack
	/// has additional capacity and is not sharing its storage with another
	/// instance, pushing an element is O(1). When an stack needs to
	/// reallocate storage before pushing or its storage is shared with
	/// another copy, pushing is O(*n*), where *n* is the size of the stack.
	///
	/// - Parameter newElement: The element to push on to the stack.
	///
	/// - Complexity: Amortized O(1) over many additions. If the stack uses an
	///   `Array` instance as its storage, the efficiency is
	///   unspecified.

	///   of the array; otherwise, O(1).
